# pyGoL
An attempt to work with pyGame while writing an increasingly improving Conway's Game of Life-implementation

TODO: 
* Put in a check to stop generation count when things become stable.
* Put the available starting points in a menu to be shown at the start
* Make things interactive:

  - allow user to save starting points
